# AutoVRSE Take Home Test Submission

This repository contains a 2D platformer game where a cube must reach the top while escaping from rising lava. The cube has several actions it can perform, including moving, dashing, jumping, double jumping, and grappling.

## Controls

- **A, D**: Move the cube left and right.
- **Left Shift**: Dash for a burst of speed.
- **Space**: Jump and double jump (when in the air).
- **Mouse Click**: Use the grapple to navigate the game world.

## Gameplay

Your objective is to guide the cube to the top of the level while avoiding the approaching lava. Here's how you can control the cube:

### Movement

Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move the cube left and right.

### Dashing

Press 'Left Shift' to perform a dash, allowing the cube to move faster for a short time.

### Jumping and Double Jump

Press the 'Space' key to make the cube jump. If the cube is already in the air, you can press 'Space' again to perform a double jump.

### Grappling

Click your mouse to use the grapple. The grapple allows you to swing and reach challenging areas.
