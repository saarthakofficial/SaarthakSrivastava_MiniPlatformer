Your objective is to guide the cube to the top of the level while avoiding the approaching lava. Here's how you can control the cube:

### Movement

Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move the cube left and right.

### Dashing

Press 'Left Shift' to perform a dash, allowing the cube to move faster for a short time.

### Jumping and Double Jump

Press the 'Space' key to make the cube jump. If the cube is already in the air, you can press 'Space' again to perform a double jump.

### Grappling

Click your mouse towards any surface to use the grapple. The grapple allows you to retract yourself to that point on the surface.
